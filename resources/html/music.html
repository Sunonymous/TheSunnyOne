        <p class="mx-3 p-3">I have played, composed, and dreamed through music for much of my life. I am blessed to be exploring the piano and improving my skills fairly often. My interest in making music right now is mostly for the joys of expression and learning, so I don't have plans at this time to formally organize the music. That may change later; who knows? Stillâ€”some have expressed interest in hearing my music, so I will provide a place to listen here.</p>
        <p class="mx-3 p-3">Music is momentary for me these days. It flows through me, and generally flows out. It's becoming more and more rare for me to mold melodies and music into full-fledged songs (that used to be the only way I'd write). These days I just explore, learning as I play.</p>
        <p class="mx-3 p-3">The easiest things for me to share right now are the two EPs I wrote under the musical moniker Brightnine (which I have since abandoned). Here is a link to the first EP, the <a class="font-semibold underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ttabyoh1knjzw9e/space-ep.zip?dl=0">Space EP</a>, and another to the second, <a class="font-semibold underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wzxqazf7mumamo0/songs-to-burn-to.zip?dl=0">Songs to Burn to</a>.</p>
        <p class="mx-3 p-3">I am also working on some <span class="font-semibold">Musical Practice Tools</span>, which anyone may use to improve the way they explore and practice musical instruments. Those should be shared on this website when they are in a workable state.</p>
