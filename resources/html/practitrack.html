        <p class="mx-3 p-3">Before I joined Launch School, I completed the preparatory courses designed to prepare their students for the deep sort of learning and study that the school facilitates. Part of this involved reading materal related to the subject of Mastery or deep learning. The subject turned out to be quite <strong>fascinating</strong>. I read more than the recommended material, and, over time, developed my own understandings.</p>
        <p class="mx-3 p-3">Programming was not my original inspiration for approaching mastery. Originally my strongest desire was to approach mastery of the system of jazz harmony, specifically with the piano (though the skills are certainly transferable). I've come to believe that Mastery is, quite simply, <span class="font-medium underline">extensive familiarity with the fundamentals of a given system</span>. Having such deep familiarity generally only comes from an incredible amount of exposure via repetition, though the benefits are easily seen. The result of developing mastery moves all interaction with the system from the conscious mind and thought into the unconscious mind. This frees one up to <em>play</em> within the system rather than to <em>think</em> about it.</p>
        <p class="mx-3 p-3">Because systems are complex, I want to develop a tool to help guide one through the process. Part of the practicing process is knowing <em>what</em> to practice. This is most easily done with the input of an existing expert.</p>
