        <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold overline m-2">Clear Language</h1>
        <p class="m-3 p-2">Throughout most of my life I have been fascinated with language. The role of language in our
            lives is inescapable, as the content of our minds is largely derived from our language. Because of this, an
            awareness of one's language (both inner and outer) can give deep insight into the structure of one's mind
            and beliefs. In particular, much of our language is chosen "unconsciously", and because of that we are often
            unaware of it. One of the things which I have wondered recently:</p>
        <p class="m-2 p-4 text-center font-semibold">Why do people declare things to be their opposites?</p>
        <p class="m-3 p-2">This is a tricky idea to wrangle into words. When you make a statement, you declare something
            to be a certain way. <span class="font-medium">"The window is clean"</span> declares that the
            window-in-question is clean. The statement is straightforward and requires little-to-no consideration to
            understand. What if I were to tell you, <span class="font-medium">"the window is <em>not</em> clean"</span>?
        </p>
        <p class="m-3 p-2">Effectively, this is a pretty <strong>useless</strong> statement, because it lacks substance.
            The statement tells us nothing about what the window <em>is</em>. It could even be a more specific
            description of "clean" (Meaning, that someone could say something like, <span class="font-medium">"It's not
                clean; it's <em>almost</em> clean."</span> People love to be specific.), so we are unable to rule out
            "clean" as a possibility entirely.
            With such a contrived example, it is easy to write this off as a trivial novelty of language, though these
            expressions litter our language like little clouds of confusion.</p>
        <p class="m-2 p-4 text-center font-medium underline underline-offset-4">Here are some more examples.</p>
        <p class="text-center p-1"><span class="font-medium">"He wasn't there."</span> ⇛ Well, where was he?</p>
        <p class="text-center p-1"><span class="font-medium">"That's not what I want."</span> ⇛ What do you want, then?
        </p>
        <p class="text-center p-1"><span class="font-medium">"I don't think so."</span> ⇛ What do you think, then?</p>
        <p class="text-center p-1"><span class="font-medium">"I'm not hungry."</span> ⇛ Then what are you??</p>
        <p class="text-center p-1"><span class="font-medium">"I haven't seen it yet."</span> ⇛ No? You'll get there.</p>
        <p class="m-3 p-2">If you want to make a negative statement like that and still get any specific message
            communicated, you <strong>must</strong> make another declaration. In other words, unclear language forces the recipient to
            make assumptions or guesses, which inevitably breed misunderstanding.
            How might we improve this? Well, the general motion is to move from stating unreality to stating reality.
            This can be approached by using specific, descriptive words instead of negating the verb "to be", such as
            saying something is <span class="font-medium">"invisible"</span> instead of that it
            <span class="font-medium">"can't be seen"</span>. Later it could be expanded upon by
            recognizing when one is stating something without substance, and choosing to state what is needed by the
            conversation and moment. The most important factor in this is one's continual attention towards oneself.
            These are habits that tend to dissolve only over extended time.
