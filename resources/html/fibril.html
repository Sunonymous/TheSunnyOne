        <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold overline m-2">Fibril</h1>
        <div class="m-6 p-2" id="intro">
            <p class="text-center">My mind, is, from a certain perspective, very organized. Its organization continues to change as I continue to live, though for some time now I've been able to navigate a very demanding life with increasing ease. I have been dreaming up a tool to facilitate keeping track of the content of a mind in a reasonable and appropriate way. I call it <strong>Fibril</strong>.</p>
            <p class="text-center">The closest thing I could give you to compare Fibril to is a Task Tracking application. I hesitate to do so, however, because Fibril is <i>different</i>. I designed Fibril because of battling todo lists for most of my life. I find these sorts of lists subpar because of a handful of things:</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="ml-2 font-semibold">Todo List Gripes</h2>
        <div class="m-6 p-2 border-2 border-double" id="todoGripes">
            <dl class="text-gray-900">
                <dt class="font-semibold text-red-700">⮾ They are static.</dt>
                <dd class="ml-4">Most of the time I've used todo apps for ideas, tools, and projects I explore. I like to explore many things (over time). Because of this, the lists tend to grow faster than they are completed. All changes to the lists are manual.</dd>
                <dt class="font-semibold text-red-700">⮾ They are all up front.</dt>
                <dd class="ml-4">This means that whenever I look at a list, I see ALL of the things at once. We already know brains can't handle excessive information. My working memory cries for better options!</dd>
                <dt class="font-semibold text-red-700">⮾ Tasks are complex.</dt>
                <dd class="ml-4">These lists make it difficult to mix layers within. Certain tasks are more open-ended than others, though todo lists keep them at the same level. Not all tasks fit snugly into boxes. Sometimes the things I am tracking aren't necessarily "tasks". Designing a system for exploration rather than purely procedural work seemed more useful to my workflow.</dd>
                <dt class="font-semibold text-red-700">⮾ They can enable procrastination.</dt>
                <dd class="ml-4">At times, lists like these keep things in the back of our minds. Having a minimal awareness of a task sometimes lets us ignore it for unreasonable amounts of time. Think about it like how some people accrue browser tabs.</dd>
            </dl>
        </div>
        <p class="text-center m-6 p-2">Fibril was designed to handle these aspects of more "static" task trackers, and, as a result, became a powerful tool to track tasks, inspirations, ideas, and explorations. It will keep what's important to you within your view, while keeping everything else safely in the background.</p>
        <h2 class="ml-2 font-semibold">Alternatives</h2>
        <p class="ml-2">How would Fibril address these things differently?</p>
        <div class="m-6 p-2 border-2 border-double" id="todoSolutions">
            <dl class="text-gray-900">
                <dt class="font-semibold text-green-500">✓ Single-File Tasks</dt>
                <dd class="ml-4">Tasks in any particular <span class="font-medium">'weave'</span> (group of tasks or topics) are shown to the user one-by-one. This prevents cognitive overload and allows users to select what interests them most to work on in any particular moment.</dd>
                <dt class="font-semibold text-green-500">✓ Dynamic Task Tracking</dt>
                <dd class="ml-4">The way the user responds to a task affects its <span class="font-medium">'resonance'</span>, which is a measure of engagement with the task. Tasks reaching a low resonance threshold will <span class="font-medium">'hibernate'</span>, which takes them out of sight.</dd>
                <dt class="font-semibold text-green-500">✓ Tasks with Data At Hand</dt>
                <dd class="ml-4">Each task has what is called its <span class="font-medium">'space'</span>, which is, ultimately, a place to store notes and references. It may be opened and modified at any time.</dd>

            <h2 class="font-semibold">Where did the name come from?</h2>
            <p>A fibril is a small fiber. It's a biology term. I chose it because it's unusual, memorable, and fits the image I envision. I like to consider tasks as fibrils because they are like golden threads of inspiration. They weave together to compose our actions. We never quite know where they will take us, so it is a great joy to follow our golden threads.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ml-2 p-2" id="progress">
            <h2 class="font-semibold">Where is the project at?</h2>
            <p>It has remained primarily (patiently) in the design phases of development for some time, while I attend to my life's other priorities first.
            Right now there is a <a class="font-semibold underline" href="https://github.com/Sunonymous/Fibril-JS">repository on my Github</a> containing some starter code. I've toyed around with various languages and tools in order to create the application, as I would like it to be as accessible for myself and others as possible.
            The current iteration is being written in JavaScript, mostly because of its universality and the fact that I can write in JavaScript pretty easily these days. I'd prefer to use another language, and if the stars align, who knows what the future will hold?</p>
            <p>If you have any related thoughts, experiences, ideas, or just want to hear more, I'd be happy to chat about this. There's a lot more to this application than what I wrote on this page.</p>
